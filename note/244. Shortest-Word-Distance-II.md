## Description
Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words *word1* and *word2* and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called *repeatedly* many times with different parameters.

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Note:**
You may assume that *word1* **does not equal to** *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.



------

## Python solution

- 使用`defaultdict(list)`来记录每个word的索引。
- 对于两个word1和word2，找到它们所在的索引，计算所有的索引之差，返回最小的那个。





```python 
from collections import defaultdict


class WordDistance:

    def __init__(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        """
        self.dd = defaultdict(list)
        for i, v in enumerate(words):
            self.dd[v].append(i)

    def shortest(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        return min(abs(i - j) for i in self.dd[word1] for j in self.dd[word2])

# Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordDistance(words)
# param_1 = obj.shortest(word1,word2)

```
