## Description
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

**Example:**

```
Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6] 

Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]

Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
```

**Follow up**: What if you are given `k` 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

**Clarification** **for the follow up question****:**
The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for `k > 2` cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example:

```
Input:
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6,7]
[8,9]

Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
```

真不知道难度为何为`middle`…



## python solution

```python
class ZigzagIterator(object):

    def __init__(self, v1, v2):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        :type v1: List[int]
        :type v2: List[int]
        """
        self.arr = []
        while v1 and v2:
            self.arr.append(v1.pop(0))
            self.arr.append(v2.pop(0))
        self.arr += v1 if v1 else v2
        

    def next(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.arr.pop(0)
        

    def hasNext(self):
        """
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return len(self.arr) > 0

# Your ZigzagIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
# i, v = ZigzagIterator(v1, v2), []
# while i.hasNext(): v.append(i.next())
```
